<h4>Challenge</h4>
<p>
	I needed a more effective tool to manage sounds for a game that I was developing. I needed a lightweight interface but precise controls.
</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
	Using angular.js, I developed an interface to play and control sounds in an extremely simple and easy-to-learn manner.
</p>
<p>
	The library was featured in a talk at Fullstack Conference in London England, where I demonstrated the library and created an MP3 player in 10 minutes using angular audio.
