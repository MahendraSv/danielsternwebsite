<h4>Challenge</h4>
<p>
	My colleague and I wanted to start a curated maple syrup delivery service, so to share Canada's great maple syrups with distant parts of the world.
</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
	A website build with Bootstrap and Grunt, with full SEO integration.
</p>
<p>
    It has full integration with Paypal and customers can sign up to have a special bottle of maple syrup sent to them each month, eh.    
</p>
